## Goal

The goal of this project is to categorize the art available via the MET API's 
(https://metmuseum.github.io/) and help people explore it. 

### Explore by Ages
The most common aproach of exploring art is through the ages. And it's something I have a struggled a lot with. I've often found it challenging to easily understand the different art movements. This project is my own attempt to remember these and explore what MET has to offer for each movement. 

### Explore All
Here people can look at everything that the MET has to offer. They can search for specific kinds of work or artists or mediums as well. 

## Design 
I wanted to keep the design as minimal and Artsy as possible. I wanted people to focus more on the Art Work thus have used light background colors and a single primary color for buttons. \
Use of animations to give more context when you are hovering over an artwork/card is anologus to a user discovering more about the art while standing in front of it in the musuem. 

## Next Steps
̐• Fix wonky animations \
• Better Error handling \
• Loading animations
